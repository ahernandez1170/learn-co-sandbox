# write an app to calculate additional fees for a rental car

# If you are under 21, you are too young to rent
# If you are over 21, and under 25, you can rent with additional $20 fee per select_day
 # And if you're in NY, you pay a flat fee of $25
 # And if you're in MI, you pay a flat fee of $20
# If you're over 25, you don't pay any additonal fees

# What pieces of data will we need from our user?
 # Age of renter
 # What state do they live in
 # How many day's are they rent for
# What data can we hard-code unto our program?
 # Fee per day - 20 dollars
 # Which states charge extra fees? - MI, NY
 # How much the fees are? - $20, $25
